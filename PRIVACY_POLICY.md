DOPAMINE BROWSER EXTENSION – PRIVACY POLICY

Last Updated: 2025-12-06

The Dopamine browser extension provides local time-tracking by recording which browser tab is currently active. All processing happens entirely on your device.

DATA COLLECTED

The extension reads the URL and title of the currently active tab.

It collects the following information:

• Active tab URL
• Active tab title
• Timestamps of tab focus and unfocus events

The extension does not collect browsing history, search history, cookies, page content, form input, keystrokes, passwords, or any personal information.

HOW DATA IS PROCESSED

All data is processed locally on your device.
The extension communicates with the Dopamine Native Host using each browser’s native messaging interface.
No data is transmitted to any external server.

DATA STORAGE

Collected data is stored only on your machine at:

%APPDATA%\Dopamine\dopamine.db


No cloud storage, remote transmission, or third-party access occurs.

NATIVE HOST COMMUNICATION

The extension sends the collected URL/time metadata to the locally installed Dopamine Native Host.
The native host writes this information directly into the local database.
The extension does not communicate with any remote endpoints.

INFORMATION SHARING

The extension does not share, sell, or transmit any data to any external services, companies, or servers.

USER CONTROL & UNINSTALLATION

Uninstalling the extension stops all data collection immediately.
Any previously stored data remains on your device until you choose to delete it manually.
The extension never removes data without your consent.

SECURITY

Communication between the extension and the native host occurs only through each browser’s native messaging system.
The extension does not inject scripts, modify websites, access page content, or interact with anything you type.
